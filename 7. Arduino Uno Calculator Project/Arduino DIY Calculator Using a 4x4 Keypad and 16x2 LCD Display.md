***Introduction***



This project demonstrates how to build a simple calculator using an Arduino UNO, a 4x4 membrane keypad for user input, and a 16x2 LCD display for output. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations, displaying results in real time. The design is compact and user-friendly, making it ideal for learning about digital input, output, and display interfacing with Arduino.



***Hardware Requirements***



* 4x4 Keypad: Matrix keypad with 16 keys (4 rows Ã— 4 columns). Each key press connects a unique row and column, allowing the Arduino to detect which key is pressed.
* Arduino UNO: Open-source microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. Handles keypad input, processes calculations, and controls the LCD display.
* 16x2 LCD Display: Liquid Crystal Display with 16 columns and 2 rows. Used to show user input and calculation results.
* Jumper Wires: For connecting the keypad, LCD, and Arduino on a breadboard.



***Working Principle***



* Input: The user enters numbers and arithmetic operations using the keypad.
* Processing: Arduino reads the keypad input, processes the arithmetic operation, and calculates the result.
* Output: The result is displayed on the 16x2 LCD display.
