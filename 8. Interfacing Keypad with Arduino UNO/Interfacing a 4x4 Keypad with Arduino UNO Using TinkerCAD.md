***Introduction***



Keypads are widely used as input devices in embedded systems, allowing users to enter numbers, characters, or commands. A 4x4 membrane keypad is a compact, matrix-style input device with 16 keys arranged in four rows and four columns. When a key is pressed, it connects a specific row and column, enabling the microcontroller to detect which key was activated. In this guide, you'll learn how to interface a 4x4 keypad with an Arduino UNO using the TinkerCAD simulation platform.



***Hardware Requirements***



* 4x4 Membrane Keypad: 16 keys (4 rows Ã— 4 columns). 8 connection pins (4 for rows, 4 for columns). Compact, pressure-pad design
* Arduino UNO R3: Open-source microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. Digital and analog I/O pins for interfacing with sensors and actuators
* Jumper Wires: For making connections between the keypad and Arduino.
* Breadboard (optional): For organized and easy circuit assembly



***How the Keypad Works***



* Each key press connects a unique row and column.
* The Arduino scans the rows and columns to detect which key is pressed.
* The Keypad library (available in the Arduino IDE) simplifies reading key presses.
