***Introduction:***



In todayâ€™s world, securing our devices and data is essential. Password protection is one of the simplest yet effective ways to safeguard access. This project demonstrates a Password Protected Security System built using Arduino and basic electronic components, simulated in TinkerCad. It provides a hands-on understanding of how digital security can be implemented at a fundamental level.



***What the Project Does***



* Allows users to enter a password via a 4x4 keypad.
* Verifies the entered password and grants or denies access.
* Uses LEDs (green for access granted, red for denied) and a piezo buzzer for visual and audio feedback.
* Simulates a security lock system suitable for protecting devices or data.



***Components Used***



* Arduino UNO: The microcontroller that processes inputs and controls outputs.
* 4x4 Keypad: For password input.
* LEDs (Red and Green): Indicate access status.
* Piezo Buzzer: Provides audible alerts.
* Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For circuit connections.
* Resistors: Protect LEDs and components from excess current.
